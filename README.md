This respository is conatains a Python script which is a solution for a stack validation problem.

**Question :** A sequence of __distinct__ numbers (or elements ) ('a') is given. Along with it, a seprate list of elements ('b') is also given. Here, 'b' represents the elements popped from a stack which should follow the sequence of push operations of elements that 'a' is having. Now here the question is to check whether 'b' is the list of elements which are popped from the stack following the sequence of elements in 'a'.

eg : if the squence of elements popped from the stack ('b') is 1,3,5,4,2 and the order of elements in 'a' is 1,2,3,4,5 then it is a valid stack. But here, if 'b' is 1,4,2,3,5 is not a valid stack.


The space and time complexity of the algorithm appplied is O(n).
